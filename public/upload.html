            STEPS TO UPLOAD A WEBSITE
        </header>
        <span>
            Uploading a website on the internet requires several steps. 
            Here’s a few guideline best to my knowledge:
        </span>
        <main>
            <h1>
                1.	Obtain a Domain name: A domain name is the address that users will use to access your site (e.g www.johnDoe.com). The domain name I will use has to be unique and registered or it can be one that I already own or also buy one, in this case, my DNS (Domain Server Name) will be configured and a wildcard certificate be given to my domain name. 
                (NB: In this case netlify is the hosting provider)
            </h1>
            <h1>
                2.	Choose a Web Hosting Provider:  I have to select a web hosting provider that will store my website files and make them accessible on the internet. Factors such as cost, reliability, customer support, and server resources have to be considered. 
            </h1>
            <h1>
                3.	Set up a Hosting Account: Here, I’ll need to sign up for a hosting account with my chosen provider. It involves creating an account, selecting a hosting package, and making the necessary payments.
            </h1>
            <h1>
                4.	Configure DNS Settings: To buttress the DNS part stated in step 1, after setting up my hosting account, I will receive DNS settings from my chosen hosting provider. These settings include nameservers that need to be associated with my domain name. After that I’ll need to access my domain registrar account and update the DNS settings to point my domain name to my hosting provider.
            </h1>
            <h1>
                5.	 I’ll upload my website which was developed using my desired web technologies among the hundreds there is. 
            </h1>
            <h1>
                6.	Set up SSL Certificate (optional but recommended): in order for me to secure my website with HTTPS, I’ll obtain and install an SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate. Some hosting provider offer free SSL certificates through services like Let’s Encrypt.
            </h1>
            <h1>
                7.	Finalize Website Configuration: Depending on my website’s requirements, I must make sure to configure any necessary server-side setting, such as databases, scripting languages (e.g PHP), or content management systems (e.g WordPress). 
            </h1>
            <h1>
                8.	Double-checking my website’s functionality, responsiveness, and performance. Once I’m satisfied with the results, I can consider my website live and accessible to the public.
            </h1>

            <span>
                NB: These steps are general guideline and specific process may vary depending on the hosting provider you use and tools used to build your website. It’s always good idea to consult the documentation and support resources provided by your hosting provider for detailed instructions.
